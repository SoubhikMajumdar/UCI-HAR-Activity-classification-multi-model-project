Human Activity Recognition project using the UCI HAR dataset (30 subjects, 6 activities, 561 features) to classify movement from smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope signals. Data is cleaned, standardized, and reduced using PCA, followed by training and tuning seven ML models. Logistic Regression achieved the highest performance with ~98% accuracy and F1-score, outperforming SVM, LDA, QDA, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
